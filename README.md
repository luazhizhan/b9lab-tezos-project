# B9Lab Tezos Project

## Introduction

The exam of [B9Lab Tezos developer course](https://tezos.b9lab.com/) required me to write an application called Dama, which is a Turkish variation of Draughts (Checkers). Most of the logics and rules of the game is written in the smart contract using [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/) and powered by [Tezos blockchain](https://tezos.com/).

## Folder Structure

- The contract folder contains the SmartPy that I have written and a Michelson file that is generated in SmartPy

- The dama folder contains an [Angular](https://angular.io/) web application which provides an interface to play the checker game

- The faucets folder consists of two babylonnet accounts which are used in this project.
